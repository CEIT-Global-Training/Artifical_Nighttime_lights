Artificial Night-time Lights (ANTL) have been widely used in social science research as a robust proxy for economic development, the quantification of disaster impacts, electricity consumption, and various other applications. However, employing ANTL in social science research requires a comprehensive understanding of confounding factors, necessitating their individual consideration based on the specific needs of the application. This training aims to provide hands-on experience in both the theory and application of ANTL.

This page provides you with the theory of artificial night-time lights and also includes codes to extract data from Google Earth Engine.
